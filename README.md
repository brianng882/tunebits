## Who Did What?
I worked solo on the entire project

## What you learned
I learned an initial implementation to React, especially how it interacts with the front-end display.
I enjoyed diving into the Tone.js feature, a React component that can play audio notes through customizable synthesizers. One step closer to acheiving my musical education goal. 
Although my UI skills were very rudimentary, I envision myself improving in the design aspect throughout the course. The most difficult part of this Hack-A-Thing project was alligning the black keys with the white keys. I'm fairly certain I overshot the logic behind it, but I hope to hone this skill with time and listening to others who already have a good grasp of front-end design. 
Overall, I had a wonderful time building this small keyboard. Hopefully it can help you hone your perfect pitch!
