# Hack Technology / Project Attempted
Tech: React, Tone.js
Project Name: TuneBits

## What you built? 
My main semester-long project idea is to build a Music Theory Learning Module. This would be similar to Duolingo's approach but specialized for introductory music theory  for those without any musical background. 

For this hack-a-thing assignment, I got my hands dirty in creating a small web-app, focusing on the React technology and and Tone.js for the musical component. My initial idea is to create a playable mini-piano with keys, and guessing the audio note by selecting the correct key. The goal is for the user to gain perfect pitch by practicing this game multiple times!

**MAKE SURE TO HAVE AUDIO ON!**
### To run the program:
1) ```cd``` into **piano-trainer/**
2) type ```npm start```

## Who Did What?
I worked solo on the entire project

## What you learned
I learned an initial implementation to React, especially how it interacts with the front-end display.
I enjoyed diving into the Tone.js feature, a React component that can play audio notes through customizable synthesizers. One step closer to acheiving my musical education goal. 
Although my UI skills were very rudimentary, I envision myself improving in the design aspect throughout the course. The most difficult part of this Hack-A-Thing project was alligning the black keys with the white keys. I'm fairly certain I overshot the logic behind it, but I hope to hone this skill with time and listening to others who already have a good grasp of front-end design. 
Overall, I had a wonderful time building this small keyboard. Hopefully it can help you hone your perfect pitch!
